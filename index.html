    <h1 class="">Context and Background</h1>
    <p>
        3D User Interfaces (3DUIs) support many important applications, including: creating virtual scenes
        for video games and movies; creating models for 3D printing and viewing 3D models of medical information.
        Despite the importance of these applications, the 3D user interfaces of these modelling packages
        have not changed much since their inception. While many interfaces have been proposed, most 3DUIs have not changed.
        In order to determine the strengths of different interfaces, we performed two experiments:
    </p>
     <ul>
        <li>
             Interactive Shadows against a traditional 3DUI with three orthographic views with three different tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
             The three most prevalent controllers (Arcball, Two Axis Valuator, and Discrete Sliders) with the two types of tasks of differing difficulty.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="">Project Goals</h1>

    <p>We aim to determine whether:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Interactive Shadows performs better than traditional multi-view 3DUIs</li>

      <li>One of the methods of rotation tested is better suited to certain class of tasks than the others</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Interactive Shadows Evaluation Findings</h2>

  <p>
  Interactive shadows were found to be significantly better in terms of distance accuracy for one task, which relied on participant distance estimations. This suggests that the interactive shadows interface might help users approximate relative object positioning.  No other significant interactions were found. We found key confounding factors that could contribute to participant performance and also draw attention to concepts that could help future researchers in this area when
  conducting similar investigations.

  <h2 class="">Rotation Controller Evaluation Findings</h2>
  <p>
We found no statistically significant differences between Arcball and Two Axis Valuator. However, we found the Discrete Sliders to be significantly more accurate for simple matching tasks (a medium to large effect) but slower for complex matching, and inspection tasks (a small to medium effect of approximately two seconds). This indicates that the Discrete Sliders are most appropriate in situations where fine-grained accuracy is valued over speed, while for other tasks, such as
inspection, either Arcball or Two Axis Valuator are better suited.
