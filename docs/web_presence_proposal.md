# Web Presence Proposal for 3DUI

## Proposal

We believe that our website should be a portfolio for the work done during the process of this project. As such, we propose that it contain all artifacts we produce during the course of the project. This includes minutes of meetings, literature surveys done and any work done towards the final report that we are allowed to release. We would like to, if allowed, include information such as our experimental design, resources used during the experiment as well as the source code for our
interfaces if we are allowed to publish these. We hope that all of these together will help other students and researchers hoping to understand and replicate our results.

## Plan

- 12/6/2015: Initial Barebones site online. This includes link to minutes, literature review, proposal, links to supervisors and a brief description of the project
- 27/7/2015: Screenshots of our interfaces, as well as release of the source code if we are allowed to do so.
- 24/7/2015: Release of draft of the background research chapter and a summary of the previous work on the page. 
- 21/8/2015: Release of page outlining design of interfaces in greater detail
- 25/9/2015: Release of page outlining implementation of the designs 
- 26/10/2015: Upload the final report
- 8/11/2015: Read through all content put on the page so far, neaten it up and fill in any missing sections
