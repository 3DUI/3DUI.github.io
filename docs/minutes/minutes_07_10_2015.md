## Meeting Notes

### Team report back
- Experiments went well!
- Participants
	- Steve: 45
	- Siobhan: 42

### Supplementary Materials
- Michelle says we cannot use this the way we had initially intended
- Brian pointed out that we could use this as a lesson to develop our concise writing skills
- Our final submission format is ACM small -> 2 columns reduces page size

### Data Analysis
- Steve: 
	- Using python with Pandas
	- Data is really not normal so an ANOVA is not appropriate
	- Friedman test is better for a repeated measures that are not parametric 
	- Noticed that accuracy has a different distribution for different controllers
	- Figured out a cool way to analyse quartonian accuracy with tate-brian. 
	
- Siobhan:
	- Using javascript with JS libraries that handle similar functions to Pandas
	- Hasn't done stat analysis yet
	- Has looked at long-answers in questionnaires - participants mention having a personal subjective preference to interface

- Notable confounding factors
	- sample size
	- previous experience with modelling interfaces

### Misc
- Steve's inspection task was misunderstood by 1 participant
- Siobhan's plane task too
- Steven worried about phrasing used for design and results chapter
	- Brian says we should look back at the example papers he's sent us
	- Brian also points out that we are worrying a bit much about the smaller things that we can refine later
- Roadblocks
	- Confidence in our stats
	- Controlling for all confounding factors

## Deliverables
- Steven & Siobhan: 
	- Deliver signed remuneration sheets to James ASAP
	- Submit polished draft on Monday
