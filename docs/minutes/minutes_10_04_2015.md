# Minutes for 10/04/2015

## Meeting notes

Siobhan has started accumulating papers focussing on her proposed title for her project,
"direct manipulation of 3D object using 2D controls". She's also looked into psychology
papers, looking at gender differences. James suggests that Siobhan look at direct
manipulation paper by Schiederman. James also suggested to add "in the context of
interactive shadows" to lit review title. 

Steven has found that there have only been 5 major studies on 3D rotations using the
mouse. James agrees this is probably right, but that he might have been stuck in a loop of
authours and that he should try expanding his search before stating that these are the
definitive papers. Steven should try to get at least 10 papers related directly to
experimentation.
