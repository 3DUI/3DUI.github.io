# Minutes for 16/04/2015

## Meeting notes

Overview: James gave feedback on our proposal, and we discussed potential future issues that may arise during and after completion of our honours project.

General thoughts
* Happy with overall document
* Well written
* Well-scoped
* Use British spelling
* Use surnames to identify each other. First names are too informal.

Materials and Procedure Queries
* High level only - in-depth is not required for this document
* Doesn't need to be too long
* Identify that we intend on iteratively doing pilots of the experiment get feedback and ensure actual experiments are smooth sailing
* Mention introductory tutorial on visualisations and interfaces for visualisations

Timeline Feedback
* Very well outlined, but too detailed
* Highlight that it represents both of our time.
* Identify that we might diverge, but this is alright

Misc Project Discussion
* DON'T DO AN INTERNSHIP IN MID-YEAR
* It's likely that we could both get publications out of our projects
* We will need to work on polishing the final product if we want this to happen
* Think of how to allocate time to do this after honours is over
