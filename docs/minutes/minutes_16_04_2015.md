# Minutes for 16/04/2015

## Meeting notes

Overview: James gave feedback on our Literature Review drafts. We asked questions on each topic for advice.

General:
* 8 page limit excluding references

Steve:
* Mostly high-level feedback
* General review content and layout strong
* No using references as nouns
* Introduction needs more emphasis on why 3D rotations are important
* Struggling to get 20 papers, because relevant literature is too small
* References are missing pages online, need to look into finding a link to the full papers. Computer Science convention requires referencing the full paper.
* Summary table should aggregate by rotation and evaluate each experiment, rather than the reverse.

Heuristics
* General HCI Heuristics
* Nielsson has a list
* Recognition over recall

Siobhan:
* More general intro
* 3D scene manipulation for displays
* Perspective view
* Direct manipulation needs to feed into 3D sections
* A step beyond programming languages - 1983
