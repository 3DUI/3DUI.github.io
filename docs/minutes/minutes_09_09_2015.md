# Minutes for 09/09/2015

## Meeting Notes

### Report back
- Steve finished pilots
  - has script to interpret his results automatically
  - 40 - 50 Minutes even with distractions due to pilot being outside lab environment
  - considering reducing task number
  - not worried about time
  - looks like there's a massive dislike arcball, discrete vs 2 axis are less disparate.
  - logging wrong information - euler angles vs quarternians
  - wanted to get angle between quarternians, but now he needs to convert the euler angles to quarternians which is complex and threejs documentation doesn't seem to allow this very nicely.
  - he's logging quarternians from now on
  - having trouble attaching textures in threejs

- Siobhan
  - pilot introduced issues that were not caught
  - will be restarting pilots tomorrow evening
  - good progress code wise
  - happy with the status of the code as a whole

- Group
  - started recruitment process
  - maria is being difficult but open
    - Steve is convincing her. Hopefully it will give us access
  - Sam & Craig need to okay the lab booking notice
  - pushing experiments back a bit

### Suggestions

### Experiments
- James okayed poster
- stagger experiments for our own insanity, as overloading US might make us go loopy.
- sign-up questionnaire is our demographic sheet
  - limits time inside the experiment
- can some participants do one of our experiments and others to both?
  - No
  - Remember if we decide for our participants to do both, we need to latin-square our experiments
- going for honours students definitely
- hitting postgrad email list
- what about a doodle-like process?
  - can't guarrantee anonymity
  - Vula sign-up sheet??
  - REMEMBER TO CHANGE BITLY LINK
