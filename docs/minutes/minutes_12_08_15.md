# Venue brainstorming

Since we can't use TSL, ideas for possible rooms:
- Brian's room (though we want to avoid due to distruption - missing machines)
- Convergence lab (missing machines)
- Games lab (small, but has machines and is well speced)
- Psychology computer labs (great)

James to check on games lab, Siobhan to check on psyche lab.

# Surveys

In the proposal, we focussed on the three Bowman metrics: user comfort, learnability and presence. Since we're not doing VR, the idea of user comfort isn't really relevant. James notes that presence is a bit of a nebulous measure, Siobhan says she'll take some of the questions desired from a presence survey and send the relevant ones across.

In terms of general usability, Siobhan found two surveys: USE and SUS. Agreed that we will use SUS, in the interests of time. In terms of getting triangulation with qualitative feedback, Siobhan suggests using the presence questionnaire questions rephrased to be open ended.

# Software

Steven demo'd his latest software responding to the heuristic feedback about task difficult. There are now three orientation matching models which have no colours and just wireframes. The inspection tasks now use concavity with colour rather than just colour. 

James asks if the models are symmetric, as that would be problematic as that would mean there's multiple correct orientations. We confirmed they aren't. James and Brian both noted that the inspection model would be easy to get lost on, so some landmarks need to be added. 

# Stats consultancy

We are awaiting the results of this, due to the address on the consulting page being incorrectly specified. Steven will follow up. 

# Deliverables

- James: speak to Sonia and Patrick about Games Lab
- Siobhan: ask about using Psyche lab
- Siobhan: pick the questions for presence and send them through
- Steven (14/08/15): follow up on stats consulting
