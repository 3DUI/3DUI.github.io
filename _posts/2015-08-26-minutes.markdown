## Meeting Notes

### Team report back

- Sorrys all round - everyone didn't do as much as they said they would have
- Heuristic evals went well

### Steven report back

- Having issues with dynamically changing the inspection task
- Questionnaires have been captured
- Looking thru James's book for stats

### Siobhan report back

- Everything on track
- Running beta tests with mom

### Misc points raised

- James says Sonia is reluctant but he will chat to her before the merit ceremony
  - UPDATE: This has been sorted out. We now have access to the Games Lab during the week under the condition that we will only use it when the Games students don't need it.
- Can we recruit 1st years? Sounds like it could be a viable option as they are all similar ages and part of a variety of faculties.
- Pilots need to be done ASAP
  - We should do more than 1, but no specific limit was set
- Brian is traveling A LOT, so he will be absent for quite some time. Best to contact via email.
- The supplimentary doc we can submit should be in the form of a technical report. Check pubs.cs.uct.ac.za for style guides.


## Deliverables

- James: approach Sonia (UPDATE: DONE)
- Steve & Siobhan: approach participants Monday 7 September
- Steve & Siobhan: Aim to submit design chapter by Monday 7 September
