<h3 id="siobhan-analysis">Siobhan Analysis</h3>

<p>Trouble with analysis</p>

<ul>
  <li>few large outliers (4), James says to run outlier tests and exclude those people from all results</li>
  <li>Have three distinct tasks which are not directly comparable as the scenes aren’t equivalent. James says to analyse each of them indepedently.</li>
  <li>For the scene task with multiple objects, we decided to construct an average score of all the measures of each object.</li>
  <li>Difference in rotation done using difference in quaternion angle formula, reporting in radians</li>
  <li>Have datasuite for all required analytics in excel/js, everything is on track</li>
  <li>How do we incorporate repetitions? Steven suggested adding that as a column with the other confounding data and controlling it for it like all the other factors</li>
</ul>

<p>Results(!)</p>

<ul>
  <li>After removing outliers for Dodecahedron task, results show shadowbox is significantly better for positioning, but not significant difference for rotations. James notes that from Steven’s results, this could be because the users probably just used in the arcball in the center for both where they could have used the shadows for a more accurate tweaking.</li>
  <li>No significant differences in the reported usability of each controller.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="steven-analysis">Steven Analysis</h3>

<p>James, after reading Steven’s draft, had some pieces of feedback:</p>

<ul>
  <li>need to make which models are used more clear. Not clear which models are used, and when they are used.</li>
  <li>currently, the tasks are specified in a table with quaternions. This should be Tait Bryan angles and there should be some sort of visualisation of them.</li>
  <li>would be interesting to see the data per question</li>
</ul>

<p>Steven promised full analysis, along with confounding factors,  would be ready by the first draft on Tuesday.</p>

<h3 id="publication">Publication</h3>

<p>James would like to publish both papers in <a href="http://i3dsymposium.github.io/">i3D</a>. The deadline for submission is the 30th of October, the same as the project deadline. The conference expects papers to be under 8 pages in length. </p>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Steven + Siobhan (21/10/15): Propose a rubric</li>
  <li>Steven + Siobhan (20/10/15): Hand in a first draft</li>
  <li>Steven + Siobhan (21/10/15): Bring James the remuneration forms</li>
  <li>Steven + Siobhan (30/10/15): Create a conference ready paper for i3D</li>
</ul>
