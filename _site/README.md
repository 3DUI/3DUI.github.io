## Generating HTML from Jeckyll

    First, you need to setup Jeckyll:

    1. Ensure you have ruby >= 2
    2. ```gem install bundler```
    3. ```bundle install```

    Then, you can either build the pages using Jeckyl

        jeckyll build

    or you can serve the pages, regenerating on change:

    jeckyll serve --watch
